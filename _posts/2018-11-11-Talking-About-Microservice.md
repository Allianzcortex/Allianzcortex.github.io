Talking about the concept of Microservice and actual implementation

<!-- more -->

Always we have two choices about microservice: [spring-cloud](http://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud) opensourced by spring community and [dubbo](https://dubbo.incubator.apache.org/en-us/) which is developed by alibaba and has been donated to Apache Foundation.Because of wide usage of SSM Framework(Spring Boot + Spring MVC(Rest) + Mybatis),I will mainly choose spring **cloud** as main research object.

During the progress of learning MapReduce,it is beneficial to find an article talking about the usage of MapReduce in practical. So I decided to translate it into Chinese and share it with others.

You can find the original novel in [finding-friends-with-mapreduce](http://stevekrenzel.com/finding-friends-with-mapreduce).
